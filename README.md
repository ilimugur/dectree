### Description

The DecTree.py file contains a Decision Tree implementation which can be used through terminal. It is an implementation of the ID3 algorithm described in [Machine Leaning book by Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html).

It can build the decision tree and output a .dot formatted file for further use. It uses the input format used by [AIspace](http://aispace.org) and can handle both training instances and test cases.

If any test cases are provided as part of the input, the tool tries to correctly classify each test example and keeps a log of its effort, in which any failures in classification, such as a test example trying to get to a non-existing branch in the decision tree, are reecorded, along with the overall test performance.

The tool can also print a text-based histogram for each node in the graph, as part of the label for the node.

Details regarding how to utilize this tool are given below.

### Execution

The program can simply be executed on any machine with an up-to-date version of Python 2, or 3 in the following fashion.

<pre>
python DecTree.py <Input_file_path>
</pre>

This will execute the tool and once it is done, you will find the decision tree generated by it in the Output.dot file, within the same directory the tool was executed.

You will also find a second output file named log.txt, in which the overall test accuracy is printed, along with straightforward error messages for the test cases where the tree failed(i.e. could not even make a guess) to classify the test instance.

The test instances present in the input are run by default. If you wish to disable the execution of testing, you may simply add the argument --disable tests, as given below.

<pre>
python DecTree.py --disable-tests <Input_file_path>
</pre>

As mentioned above, you can add a histogram to the label of each node. This behavior is disabled by default, but you can add the argument --hist if you wish to enable it.

The order of the file path as well as arguments --hist and --disable-tests are irrelevant. After you type *python DecTree.py*, you may write them in any order.

Finally, there is also a help argument you may call by -h or --h to view basically the same information mentioned in this section, if you feel like viewing a more concise version of it.
